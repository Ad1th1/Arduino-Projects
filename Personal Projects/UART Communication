UART Code

//sender
char ip;
void setup()  
{
  Serial.begin(9600);
  Serial1.begin(9600);
}
void loop()  
{

    Serial1.write("at last \n");   //writing to receiver
   
}

//receiver
void setup()  
{
  Serial.begin(9600);
  Serial1.begin(9600);
}
void loop()  
{

  {
    ip=Serial1.read();

  }
}


# The code didn't run for a long time because I connected to TX0 and RX0. Then we used the Softserial library. We realized that we didn't need to use this library as we had enough RX/TX pins. We then wrote our code using Serial and Serial1. We took a while to figure out a bug in our code.
