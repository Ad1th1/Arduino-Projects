A simple image-recognition algorithm that can correctly classify pictures as cat or non-cat.

Common steps for pre-processing a new dataset are:

Figure out the dimensions and shapes of the problem (m_train, m_test, num_px, ...)
Reshape the datasets such that each example is now a vector of size (num_px * num_px * 3, 1)
"Standardize" the data
