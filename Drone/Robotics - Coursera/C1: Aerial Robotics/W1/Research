Feedback Controllers

Open loop systems = not useful if we want accuracy
input -> plant -> output

plant = system we want to effect


PID Controller
PID = Proportional Integral Derivative
tune the controller

proportional control alone can create a steady-state error => Kp
integral control = keeps memory of the past  => Ki
derivative control = how fast is the error shrinking => Kd
  -> looks at current rate of error change
  -> determines how fast we are approaching our goal
  ->
