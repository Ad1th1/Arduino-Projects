Localization is finding what and where an object exists in an image

Object Detection is finding what and where multiple object exist in an image

For localization, we need at least 4 more points to define a bounding box
Two common ways:
  1. Upper left and bottom right corners
  2. 2 corner points, height and width of the image
  
Sliding window
  Disadvantages:
  -lots of computation
  - many bounding boxes for the same object
  
Regional based networks R-CNN
- very tricky to implement
- slow, complicated 2 step process

YOLO algorithm
- split into a 7 by 7 grid
- every cell is responsible for predicting a bounding box
- 4 papers on yolo

Target Predicted bounding box
  - Intersection over union approach
