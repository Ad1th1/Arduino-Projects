-> The best time to learn Git was yesterday (lol)
-> Git = world's most popular version control system

-> version control = software that tracks and manahes changes to file over time
                   = allow users to revisit file versions, compare and undo changes
                   = other examples -> Subversion
     
Difference between Git and Github
Git
  ~ version control software 
  ~ runs locally on machine
  ~ don't need the Internet
  
Github
