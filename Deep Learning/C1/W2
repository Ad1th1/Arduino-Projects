Figure out the dimensions and shapes of the problem (m_train, m_test, num_px, ...)
Reshape the datasets such that each example is now a vector of size (num_px * num_px * 3, 1)
"Standardize" the data

design OF  a simple algorithm to distinguish cat images from non-cat images using Logistic Regression,

𝑧(𝑖)=𝑤𝑇𝑥(𝑖)+𝑏(1)
𝑦̂ (𝑖)=𝑎(𝑖)=𝑠𝑖𝑔𝑚𝑜𝑖𝑑(𝑧(𝑖))(2)


Preprocessing the dataset is important.
You implemented each function separately: initialize(), propagate(), optimize(). Then you built a model().
Tuning the learning rate (which is an example of a "hyperparameter") can make a big difference to the algorithm.
