IP Design

IP = Network Layer Protocol
   = unreliable and connectionless
   = best-effort delivery service
   = packet of IP layer = datagram = variable-length packet containing 2 parts = header and data
   = header = 20 - 60 bytes in length = contains info necessary for routing and delivery
   
IP datagram header
VER(4 bits) Hlen(4 bits) Differentiated Services(8 bits) | Total length(16 bits)
Identification(16 bits)             | Flags(3 bits) Fragmentation Offset(13 bits)

Differentiated Service
   Service types
   Type Of Service (TOS) bits are a set of four-bit flags in the IP header
   DTRC
   TOS-Bits
   1000      D: minimize delay 
   0100      T: maximize throughput 
   0010      R: maximize reliability
   0001      C: maximize cost
   0000      Normal(default)


   The DS codepoint (DSCP) defines in the packet header the action that any Diffserv-aware system should take on a marked packet.
   Value for Codepoint
   XX0 = Internet
   X11 = Local
   X01 = Temporary or experimental

-> Precedence subfield was designed but never used in IPv4
-> Total length field = Total length of data + header = minimum of 46 bytes

-> Transport Layer: TCP & UDP
-> Network Layer: Header + ICMP + IGMP + OSPF + TCP + UDP
-> Gathering data from multiple application processes of the sender, enveloping that data with a header, and sending them as a whole to the intended 
receiver is called multiplexing. 
-> Value : Protocol = 1:ICMP, 2:IGMP, 6:TCP, 17:UDP, 89:OSPF

-> hlen * 4 = number of bytes
-> 1 byte = 2 hexadecimal digits

-> Fragmentation = datagram is fragmented to fit protocol regulations
    -> MTU = Max length of data that can be encapsulated in a frame
    -> Fields related to fragmentation
    
-> MTU:
    At host: select MTU of link it is connected to
    At intermediate router: forward the datagram on a network with smaller MTU
    Reassemby is best done at destination
    Fragmentation fields = 
    -> identification = helps identify a datagram(all fragments carry the same identification)
    -> flags = 3 bits
        bit 0 = reserved(set to 0)
        bit 1 = don't fragment = useful for path MTU discovery
        bit 2 = more fragments = set to 1 to indicate more fragments to follow
    -> fragmentation offset
       -> measures data/payload in 8-byte blocks
       -> for a parti
           
->  Options = max of 40 bytes
     Format = Code(8 bits) Length(8 bits) Pointer(Variable length) O-FLow(4 bits) Flags(4 bits)

              Last IP Address
              
        Code = Copy(1 bit) Class(2 bits) NUmber(5 bits)
        if first bit is 1 = copy
        bit 2 & 3: 00 => datagram control
                   10 => debugging and management
                   
        
     Single Byte - no operation
                 - end of option
     Multiple-Byte - record route
                   - strict source rout
                   - loose source route
                   - timestamp
     NO op = used to beginning/end of option
       
       
 Error detection method used by TCP/IP protocols = checksum
 -> protects against corruption that may occur during packet transmission
 -> redundant info added to the packet

Checksum
created at sender's side

# k sections, n bits each
-> break original message into k blocks with n bits in each block
-> sum k data blocks
-> do 1's complement to the sum = checksum

at receiver's side:
-> sum of data and checksum = all 1's => no error
