IP Design

IP = Network Layer Protocol
   = unreliable and connectionless
   = best-effort delivery service
   = packet of IP layer = datagram = variable-length packet containing 2 parts = header and data
   = header = 20 - 60 bytes in length = contains info necessary for routing and delivery
   
IP datagram header
VER(4 bits) Hlen(4 bits) DS(8 bits) | Total length(16 bits)
Identification(16 bits)             | Flags(3 bits) Fragmentation Offset(13 bits)
TTL(8 bits) Protocol(8 bits)        | Header Checksum(16 bits)
Source IP Address
Destination IP Address

Service types
Type Of Service (TOS) bits are a set of four-bit flags in the IP header
DTRC
TOS-Bits
1000      D: minimize delay 
0100      T: maximize throughput 
0010      R: maximize reliability
0001      C: maximize cost
0000      Normal(default)

The DS codepoint (DSCP) defines in the packet header the action that any Diffserv-aware system should take on a marked packet.
Value for Codepoint
XX0 = Internet
X11 = Local
X01 = Temporary or experimental

-> Precedence subfield was designed but never used in IPv4
-> Total length field = Total length of data + header = minimum of 46 bytes

-> Transport Layer: TCP & UDP
-> Network Layer: Header + ICMP + IGMP + OSPF + TCP + UDP
-> Gathering data from multiple application processes of the sender, enveloping that data with a header, and sending them as a whole to the intended 
receiver is called multiplexing. 
-> Value : Protocol = 1:ICMP, 2:IGMP, 6:TCP, 17:UDP, 89:OSPF

-> hlen * 4 = number of bytes
-> 1 byte = 2 hexadecimal digits

-> Fragmentation = datagram is fragmented to fit protocol regulations
    -> MTU = Max length of data that can be encapsulated in a frame
    -> Fields related to fragmentation
    
-> MTU:
    At host: select MTU of link it is connected to
    At intermediate router: forward the datagram on a network with smaller MTU
    Reassemby is best done at destination
    Fragmentation fields = 
    -> identification = helps identify a datagram(all fragments carry the same identification)
    -> flags = 3 bits
        bit 0 = reserved(set to 0)
        bit 1 = don't fragment = useful for path MTU discovery
        bit 2 = more fragments = set to 1 to indicate more fragments to follow
    -> fragmentation offset
       -> measures data/payload in 8-byte blocks
       -> for a parti
           
->  Options = max of 40 bytes
     Format = Code(8 bits) Length(8 bits) Data(Variable length)
        Code = Copy(1 bit) Class(2 bits) NUmber(5 bits)
