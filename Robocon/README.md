My introduction to robotics and my first competition required me to work on making a robot to play an Indian game, lagori. 

I coded a couple arduinos, one for a bot that would throw balls at the opponent and another for a bot that would assemble the stones in a pile, as determined by the rules.

It was fun and I realized how absolutely frustrating hardware could be.
